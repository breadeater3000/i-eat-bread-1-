        <h2>you ruined everything with logic</h2>
        <p>so i fixed the grammar mistakes i made.</p>
        <div>
            <p>kinda wish there was grammarly for coding though, but i know that would be a bad idea.</p> 
<hr>
<p>i think i'll make this like an official website that anyone can access and remove all the real life names,
    then i'll just post cat pictures here every once in a while.
    that would be fun lol.
